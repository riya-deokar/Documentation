Sprint 5 
=====================================

I have been actively creating an Open Education Project (OPE) textbook.

I initiated the project by generating a book using command-line tools. I customized the book's settings and content structure by editing YAML configuration files.

I used Git for version control, enabling efficient collaboration with team members. I committed changes and pushed them to GitHub repositories, ensuring up-to-date documentation and resolving conflicts.

For now I wanted to experiment with pulishing my own book and URL as a user would, however for the final sprint Intent to fork into Isaiah's repo

The material that I have documented and intend to document will be split up into a few parts and chapters:
1. Documentation of creating a textbook, lab, quiz, lecture notes, and styling and formatting, errors that users may run into 
2. Documentation of learnings of the group that may impactthe user's experience (fore example git hub actions and why we have them)
3. Drawings and architechture of teammates progress and how our content comes together
